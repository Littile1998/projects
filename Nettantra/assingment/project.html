<h1><center>A Performance-to-Cost Analysis of IEEE 802.15.4
  MAC With 802.15.4e MAC Modes</center></h1>
<p><h3>The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is one of the widely adopted networking specification for Internet
  of Things (IoT). It defines several physical layer (PHY) options and medium access control (MAC) sub-layer
  protocols for interconnection of constrained wireless devices. These devices are usually battery-powered and
  need to support requirements like low-power consumption and low-data rates.</h3></p>
<p><h3>IEEE 802.15.4e defines five different MAC
  behaviors, viz., Blink RFID, AMCA, LLDN, DSME, and
  TSCH. Both RFID and AMCA are the two non-real-time
  MAC behaviors. Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME)
  and Time-slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) MAC modes of IEEE 802.15.4e.</h3></p>
<p><h3> In this paper, we carry
  out a performance-to-cost analysis of Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME)
  and Time-slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) MAC modes of IEEE 802.15.4e with 802.15.4 MAC protocol
  to analyze the trade-off of choosing a particular MAC mode over others.</h3></p>
<p><h2> Applications of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.4e:</h2>
<h3>802.15.4 MAC is suitable for applications with
  flexible requirements of latency and throughput. Where as, to meet
  specific Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of different industrial applications, the IEEE 802.15.4e
  amendment was released that focuses on improving reliability, robustness and latency.</h3></p>
